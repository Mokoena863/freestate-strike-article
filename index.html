    <h1>Free State School Staff Face Delayed Payments Amid Ongoing Union Strike</h1>
    <div class="date">Tuesday, 13 May 2025</div>

    <p>School staff across the Free State province continue to face delayed salary payments as the South African Democratic Teachers Union (SADTU) persists with its strike action demanding better working conditions and increased funding for education.</p>

    <p>Teachers and support staff from several schools have reported not receiving their salaries for the past two months, causing growing concern among employees and their families. The strike, which began earlier this year, remains unresolved despite ongoing negotiations between the union representatives and provincial education authorities.</p>

    <p>A spokesperson for the Free State Department of Education confirmed that payroll processes have been temporarily suspended until the dispute is settled. "Unfortunately, the payroll system is currently on hold due to the industrial action. We urge staff to remain patient as discussions continue," said the spokesperson.</p>

    <p>One educator from Bloemfontein, who wished to remain anonymous, said, "We were told the payroll system is frozen until this issue is resolved. Itâ€™s been very difficult managing without our salaries, but we stand united in our demands for fair treatment."</p>

    <p>The South African Democratic Teachers Union continues to urge the provincial government to address their concerns promptly, warning that prolonged delays could impact the quality of education services.</p>

    <p>The community and parents are also watching closely, hoping for a swift resolution to the strike to avoid further disruption to the academic calendar.</p>
